Some decisions are just so easy to make. Joining the [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) team and helping them build a brand new Prague office was one of them. After talking to co-founders Timo and Martin and then 10+ other people, after making a lovely trip to Estonia, things just started making more and more sense and finally everything has clicked together. Making the final decision a walk in a rose garden. Read more to see why.

Pipedrive is not new to me. A bunch (a rather a large bunch) of fellow ex-Skypers work there, so I was able to watch their story first-hand through their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles. In short Pipedrive is a hyper-growth, next generation, global cloud software company founded in 2010 in Estonia and based in Europe and the US. It became a leading CRM and Sales Management platform for SMBs, disrupting the market for big players.

There are multiple reasons behind my decision and why I think it will attract many good people in Prague:

1. **I strongly believe in the product.** I have no experience with Sales or tools for Sales teams, but after I've read all the reviews and after experiencing it by my self by creating my own dummy team of one and tracking my own job interviewing pipeline in it, I understood why it became so popular and what drives that amazing growth. It's a tool built for people by people who love it and you can see it at the end result.

2. **The people and company values.** Every single person I talked to, I loved. I got a pretty good sample, different roles too. Every single one was dedicated to their work and all of them have highlighted how much they value the team they're part of and how much attention they pay to the cultural fit when hiring new people. I can relate 100% to all of the company values, my favourite one being "Don't ruin other people's day". That's just spot on :) Overall, it felt like talking to a group of very good friends.

3. **The technology.** Being based on people who have been there when Skype's amazing backend infrastructure has been built, the team at Pipedrive has built a platform, which has matured over those years into something everyone is proud of and people enjoy working on. Unlike similar size and age startups I've experienced, Pipedrive has a thought-through micro-services based infrastructure based on Node.js and front end written in React.js. Their CI/CD is completely automated, you can deploy to production by just adding a label in Github and the average waiting time is 10 minutes, including building, running tests and deployment. That's just WOW! I cannot wait to try it all out myself.

4. **Innovative approach to the agile delivery process.** Tribes and missions model actually well thought through and implemented! Managing teams from 6-38 people myself, I've concluded to the same thing - to keep developers motivated in the long run, you need to give them challenges, they need to feel in charge and they need to feel variance in their work routine. I'll be definitely covering more on this topic as I see it working in real life, but this by its own is one of the best things about Pipedrive.

5. **My personal challenge.** Building a team from scratch in a brand new location is a great challenge and I cannot wait to get started.

As you can see, after adding all of these pieces together, making the final decision really was easy.

I will be posting a lot about individual aspects as I learn more myself, but if you cannot wait to know more in person already, ping me and let's grab a coffee together!
